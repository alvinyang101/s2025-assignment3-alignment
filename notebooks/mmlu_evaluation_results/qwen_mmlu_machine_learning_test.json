Statement 2| Setting the bias parameters in each layer of neural network to 0 changes the bias-variance trade-off such that the model's variance increases and the model's bias decreases\n(A) True, True  (B) False, False  (C) True, False  (D) False, True  \nAnswer: (C)\nExplanation: Statement 1 is true"
